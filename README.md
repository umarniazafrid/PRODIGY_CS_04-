# PRODIGY_CS_04 - Simple Keylogger (Python)

This is Task 04 of my **Cyber Security Internship** with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🔹 Description
A basic **local-only** keylogger built in Python for educational purposes.  
It records keystrokes and saves them to a local file `key_log.txt`.  

⚠️ **Ethical Notice:** This program is for learning purposes only.  
Never run it on a device without the owner’s consent.

## 🚀 How to Run

pip install pynput
python3 keylogger.py
You can also run the c++ code that I have written it.
