# PRODIGY_CS_04 - Simple Keylogger (Python, C++)

This is **Task 04** of my Cyber Security Internship with **Prodigy InfoTech**.

---

## 🔹 Description
A basic **local-only keylogger** built in **Python** and **C++** for educational purposes.  
It records keystrokes and saves them to a local file (`key_log.txt`).

⚠️ **Ethical Notice**  
This program is strictly for **learning and research purposes**.  
Never use it on any system without the explicit consent of the owner.

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Python)

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install `pynput`:


pip install pynput

2. Run the Keylogger

python3 keylogger.py

Keystrokes will be logged in key_log.txt.
💻 How to Run (C++)

    Compile the C++ code (example using g++):

g++ keylogger.cpp -o keylogger

Run the executable:

    ./keylogger

Keystrokes will be logged in the same key_log.txt file.
📂 Files

    keylogger.py → Python implementation

    keylogger.cpp → C++ implementation

    key_log.txt → Output file where keystrokes are recorded

⚡ Notes

    This project is part of my internship tasks and is not intended for malicious use.

    The C++ version may require administrator/root privileges depending on the OS.


Do you want me to also add **setup instructions for Kali Linux (apt + pip)**, like I explained for Scapy, so your README style is consistent across tasks?
